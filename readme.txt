== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How does one use the shortcode, exactly? =
Actually there is a single shortcode - "import_config".

<http://smartcalc.es/wp/index.php/2015/06/01/google-calendar/> - complete list of attribute values for this shortcode has been provided to answer this exact question.

= I have installed the plugin, but the counter doesn't appear in available widgets list. =
Do not forget to install and activate the main plugin - Smart Countdown FX.

= I have configured the widget but it is not displayed. =
Please, check "Counter display mode" setting in the widget options. If "Auto - both countdown and countup" is not selected, the widget might have been automatically hidden because the event is still in the future or already in the past. If you are using "Smart Countdown FX Google Calendar Bridge" plugin check that "Import events from:" setting is correct. Then go to "Smart Countdown FX Google Calendar Bridge" settings and make sure that configurationselected in "Import events from:" is not set to "Disabled".
**Linking a widget to a disabled configuration will hide the counter becuse no events will be found**

= I have inserted the countdown in a post, but it is not displayed. What's wrong? =
Check the spelling of "fx_preset" attribute (if you included it in attributes list). Try the standard fx_preset="Sliding_text_fade.xml". Also check "mode" attribute. Set in to "auto". If you are using Google Calendar Bridge plugin check that import_config attribute is correct, e.g.: import_config="scd_google_cal::1" to use the first pattern. Then go to "Smart Countdown FX Google Calendar Bridge" settings and make sure that Configuration 1 "Authorization" is not set to "Disabled".
**Linking a widget to a disabled configuration will hide the counter becuse no events will be found**
